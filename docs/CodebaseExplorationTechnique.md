## Levels of Granularity:

Here are the key aspects sorted by their level of granularity, from the highest (coarsest) level to the lowest (finest) level:

1. **Highest Level (System/Application)**
   - Architecture
   - Entry Points
   - Dependencies and Integration Points
   - Logging and Monitoring
   - (Version Control and Commit History)

2. **High Level (Modules/Components)**
   - Design Patterns
   - Control Flow
   - Data Flow
   - Code Organization and File Structure

3. **Mid Level (Classes/Functions)**
   - Domain Concepts and Business Rules
   - Algorithms and Data Structures
   - Error Handling and Exception Management
   - Concurrency and Synchronization Mechanisms
   - Performance and Scalability Considerations
   - Security Aspects

4. **Low Level (Implementation Details)**
   - Naming Conventions
   - Code Comments and Documentation
   - Variable and Method Signatures
   - Code Complexity and Readability
   - Unit Tests and Code Coverage

This sorting represents a general hierarchy, where the higher-level aspects provide an overview and context for the system as a whole, while the lower-level aspects focus on the finer details of implementation and individual components.

1. **Highest Level (System/Application)**: These aspects concern the overall structure, entry points, and integration points of the entire application or system. They provide a high-level understanding of the codebase and its interactions with external dependencies and systems.

2. **High Level (Modules/Components)**: These aspects relate to the organization and design of individual modules or components within the codebase. They encompass design patterns and control- & data-flow.

3. **Mid Level (Classes/Functions)**: These aspects focus on the functionality and implementation details of individual classes, functions, or modules. They include domain concepts, algorithms, error handling, performance considerations, security aspects and concurrency mechanisms specific to each component.

4. **Low Level (Implementation Details)**: These aspects concern the finer details of the code itself, such as naming conventions, comments, variable and method signatures, code complexity, and unit tests. They provide insights into the readability, maintainability, and testability of the codebase at the lowest level of granularity.

It's important to note that while this sorting represents a general hierarchy, there may be some overlap or interdependencies between aspects at different levels. Additionally, the importance or priority of each aspect may vary depending on the specific requirements, domain, and characteristics of the codebase being analyzed.
