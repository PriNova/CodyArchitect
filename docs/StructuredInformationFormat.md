**Structured Information Format**

1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):

    - JSON is a lightweight, human-readable, and widely supported data interchange format.
    - It represents data as key-value pairs and supports nested structures, making it suitable for storing hierarchical information.
    - You can create a JSON object that contains fields like "project_description," "setup_instructions," and "contribution_guidelines" to store the corresponding extracted information.
    - JSON can be easily parsed and processed by various programming languages and libraries.
    - Example:
        ```json
        {
            "project_description": "A powerful tool for analyzing codebases.",
            "setup_instructions": "1. Clone the repository\n2. Install dependencies\n3. Run the setup script",
            "contribution_guidelines": "- Fork the repository\n- Create a new branch\n- Submit a pull request",
            "license_details": "This project is licensed under the MIT License."
        }
        ```
